rochesterastronomy.org/snimages/very useful websiteLBV checkinggohome command went to his home computercd proposalupdated old sn list to include new data after 2011ad.  Just use this list for all supernovae.sn.chris.list inside the following directoryinstructions in sn.christ.list.READMEdirectory cetus/weidong/chrisB4400 supernovae in listdate magnitude CBAD# RA and DEC Type Discoverergal.kait.list in folder as wellinstructions in gal.kait.list.README filechoose just IIn and ignore ? and II? for nowcetus/weidong/survey/log3one log file is already in my directorythere is also a README version of itgenerally dont want to use images with very high sky backgroundgetnewsn-chris.py code in /database/unfilter/database/data_chris/newsn-chris.list is used in the getnewsn-chris.py codeComents of this file is there as well, only use first 3 columns (README)newsn-chris.list make a list with the first 3 columns for all of the SN of interest with name and # from eachof the two different files and the data.python < getnewsn-chris.py run in unfilter folder with new updated list also in folderMS is another guy we have data from but it is not in the computer I am using.  OK to ignore messages about data from MS./database/data-chris/sn2011ef was createdin .fits files name gives _c for clear filter or bvri for filter and then date from discovery date and last .## is thenumbered label of that image from that day, so 5 is the 5th image taken that day.After lunch break meeting:mkdir ref/whale/weidong/F20721.fit ./sn2011ef.fitKeep only 1 fits file from each day so that the date of discovery doesn't have hundreds of fits files (way to do this is to create a temp with a few of the files and then delete all of them and move the temp ones back).uncompress

used in the alignment procedureparamters to change at start may be useful:saturationthresh gives you how many sigma are used to detect the stars so the lower the value the more stars it will use to aligntemplates don't necessarily have supernovashift doesn't always work properlyview.cl to go through files and say yes or nomake sure view.cl is it in the foldertask $vvv=view.clview.cl

images and also had most importantstars inside its data setimcombine using sum is worse than average probably so use averageuse displ comb26 2 and things like that for ds9 displaysub.cl does subtractionsn.fit is the template filemake sure to make a list of all of the combined filessubtract.pl script resides in a location you need to link toactually runalard.pl not subtract so we dont do the shift againtask $sss=sub.climexam of all the sub.fits filesAlternative viewing method to check image subtractions in check.cl in sub folderOn a monthly basis or a seasonly basis might be better because if you do by number of images we have a hard time saying what the midtime is or if there are large time gapsimcopy comb19.fit[*.-*] t1.fitt1.fit is just flipped version
